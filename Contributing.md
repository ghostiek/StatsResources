# Contributing

Any help to this project would be greatly appreciated! Here are the different methods through which you may contribute, they are all fairly straightforward.

### Through our Discord

The most straightforward way to go, as it doesn't even require a GitHub account, would be to join our [Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/PPvDstH) and add your resource to the #resource channel.

### Opening an Issue manually

Click on the Topic Name template and just fill in accordingly!

### Opening a Pull Request

Just fork the repository, make your changes, and explain them in the Pull Request using the same format as when opening an issue. Ideally following the format in the Issue Template as such

```
**What topic are you suggesting we include?**
Topic Name

**What are the Resource Link(s)**
Resource Link(s)

**(Optional) What category does it belong to? If missing, what directory should we add?**
Category/Directory
```
